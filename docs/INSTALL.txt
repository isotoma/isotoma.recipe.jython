Installation
============

Since this is a Buildout recipe, there's nothing really to install.  Just
mention the recipe name in a buildout and enjoy!  For example, your
``buildout.cfg`` might be something like this::

    [buildout]
    develop = src/myegg
    parts =
        jython
        myegg
    [jython]
    recipe = sk.recipe.jython
    [myegg]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    python = jython
    interpreter = mypy
    eggs = myegg

The above buildout accomplishes the following:

* Specifies a Python egg in-development in ``src/myegg``.
* Downloads and installs Jython.
* Creates a new interpreter ``bin/mypy`` pre-baked with ``myegg`` and powered
  by Jython.

Easy!
